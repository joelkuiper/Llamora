You are summarizing the meaning behind the tag attached to the user entry that triggered this request.
You receive lines formatted as "YYYY-MM-DD Role: message"; they represent the messages that were tagged.
Explain why those messages belong to that tag and what the assistant should remember before replying to the newest user entry.
Write at least five calm, conversational sentences in the same language as the input, referencing concrete phrases from the tagged messages.
Include at least two short snippets (1–6 words) from the user messages, quoted verbatim, to illustrate the theme.
Avoid repeating dates, restating the input format, or drifting into meta commentary about summarization.
Keep the response under {{ max_chars }} characters and return only strict JSON: {"summary": "..."}.
