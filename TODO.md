# TODO

- [X] The prompt context now always takes the whole conversation, which makes no sense (introduce a proper "context" = tags and their enrichment + history up until that point)
- [ ] New llamora replies appear at the top, then on refresh are at the bottom
- [ ] Delete replies / user messages
- [ ] Better UI for the different kinds of replies
- [ ] "Message kind" leaks (should not be visible, maybe a small icon)
- [ ] Disable replies after today?
- [ ] Day opening is broken (and where to put it), midnight refresh seems broken
- [ ] Re-generate of assistant messages?
- [ ] Edit for user messages?
- [ ] No concept of time / timestamp on messages (should be accessible somewhere)
- [ ] A lot of code clean up / refactoring
